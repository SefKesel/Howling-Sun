# HowlingSun
A classic fantasy RPG mod for Minecraft inspired by HowlingMoon Mod, where vampires, werewolves, demigods and other classes coexist to give the game a more powerful experience, where you don't need weapons or armor to fight for your life.  
Are you tired of doing complex rituals, endless crafting with strange and difficult to get items, just to be a little stronger? This is your mod, just kill, level up, and get stronger for the rest of the game.
